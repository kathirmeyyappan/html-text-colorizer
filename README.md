# html-text-colorizer
This is a simple Microsoft GUI tool which colorizes text in custom linear gradient, outputting copy-pastable HTML code for use. I created it to learn .NET and get familiar with C#.

## Use
Essentially, the inputted text is run through one of 4 algorithms, which will colorize it in a certain manner, outputting usable HTML code which corresponds to the preview (shown at the very bottom). Below are some use cases.
